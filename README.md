# Batmanuel

**Batmanuel** is a code quality platform built with NestJS. It analyzes repositories to measure code quality, detect duplicated code, and evaluate results through a configurable rules engine that produces a consolidated score and quality gate decision.

## Architecture Overview

Batmanuel currently acts as an orchestrator for internal analysis engines plus a scoring layer. It scans source code, normalizes findings into a common `AnalysisReport`, evaluates the result through `RulesService`, and returns a quality gate response for a given project, branch, and commit.

```text
GitHub Actions / Client
          |
          v
   Batmanuel API (NestJS)
          |
          +--> Auth module (project token validation)
          |
          +--> Analyze module
          |      |
          |      +--> DuplicationService
          |      +--> RulesService
          |
          v
   AnalysisReport + score + threshold + passed
```

At this stage, the API supports uploaded repository archives via POST /analyze/upload, which allows CI pipelines to send a zipped version of the repository instead of relying on a server-side filesystem path. Local analysis of the current project is handled by the Batmanuel CLI, which runs the same analysis pipeline directly on the working directory.

### Module responsibilities

- `auth/`: generates and validates Bearer tokens for protected endpoints.
- `analyze/`: receives analysis requests, orchestrates engines, and returns normalized reports.
- `engines/`: contains concrete analyzers such as `DuplicationService` and `DependencyScannerService`.
- `rules/`: contains the scoring and threshold logic, exposed through `RulesService` and configured through the exported `RULES_CONFIG` provider token.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Running locally

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Testing `POST /analyze/upload`

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/analyze/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>" \
  -F "projectId=my-project-backend" \
  -F "branch=main" \
  -F "commit=abc123" \
  -F "file=@source-code.zip"
```

---

## CLI Usage

Batmanuel can also be used as a local CLI tool to analyze the current project without exposing an HTTP endpoint.

### Running the CLI in a project

Inside the Batmanuel repository, you can run:

```bash
npx ts-node bin/cli.ts analyze .
```

This command:

- creates a NestJS application context for `AnalyzeModule`;
- runs the same analysis pipeline used by `POST /analyze/upload`;
- prints the JSON `AnalysisReport` (score, threshold, passed, metrics, issues) to stdout.

By default, the CLI uses:

- `sourcePath`: the current working directory (or the path you pass as the first argument);
- `projectId`: the basename of the target directory (e.g. `batmanuel` for `/Users/you/projects/batmanuel`).

### Integrating Batmanuel as a dependency

To use Batmanuel as a CLI in another project:

1. Install Batmanuel as a dependency (once it is published to npm):

   ```bash
   npm install batmanuel --save-dev
   ```

2. Add an npm script to your project:

   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "batmanuel:analyze": "batmanuel analyze ."
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run the analysis from the project root:

   ```bash
   npm run batmanuel:analyze
   ```

This makes it easy to integrate Batmanuel into local workflows and CI pipelines without running a separate API server.

## API Routes

### POST /auth/token

Generates an access token for a given project. This token must be used to authenticate all subsequent requests to protected routes.

**Request body:**

```json

```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "projectId": "my-project-backend",
  "token": "<GENERATED_TOKEN>",
  "expiresIn": "30d"
}
```

---

### POST /analyze/upload

Uploads a zipped repository with `multipart/form-data`, extracts it in a temporary directory, resolves the source directory, and runs the same analysis pipeline used by `POST /analyze`. This endpoint is designed for CI environments where the API cannot access the repository path directly on the runner.

**Form fields:**

- `projectId`: unique project identifier
- `branch`: analyzed branch
- `commit`: analyzed commit SHA
- `file`: zipped repository archive

**Example request:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/analyze/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>" \
  -F "projectId=my-project-backend" \
  -F "branch=main" \
  -F "commit=abc123" \
  -F "file=@source-code.zip"
```

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "projectId": "my-project-backend",
  "branch": "main",
  "commit": "abc123",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-15T15:00:00.000Z",
  "score": 100,
  "passed": true,
  "threshold": 70,
  "metrics": {
    "securityCritical": 0,
    "securityHigh": 0,
    "securityMedium": 0,
    "qualitySmells": 0,
    "duplications": 0,
    "outdatedDeps": 0
  },
  "issues": []
}
```

---

### GET /analyze/:projectId/summary

Returns a summary for a given project. Requires authentication.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "projectId": "my-project-backend",
  "lastScore": 82,
  "trend": [76, 78, 80, 82],
  "lastAnalysisAt": "2026-07-15T15:00:00.000Z"
}
```

---

## Rules Engine

Batmanuel now includes a dedicated `rules/` module responsible for turning raw findings into a final score and quality gate decision.

### Components

- `rules.constants.ts`: declares the injection token, currently `RULES_CONFIG`.
- `interfaces/rules-config.interface.ts`: defines the shape of the rules configuration.
- `config/default-rules.config.ts`: holds the default scoring and threshold values.
- `rules.service.ts`: evaluates findings and returns score, threshold, pass/fail, and breakdown data.
- `rules.module.ts`: registers and exports both `RulesService` and `RULES_CONFIG`.

### Flow

1. An analysis engine generates findings, such as duplicated blocks.
2. `AnalyzeService` converts those findings into normalized `Issue[]`.
3. `RulesService.evaluate(...)` applies penalties and thresholds from the injected config.
4. The final API response includes:
   - `score`
   - `passed`
   - `threshold`
   - metrics and issues

### Example conceptual config

```ts
export const DEFAULT_RULES_CONFIG = {
  threshold: 70,
  penalties: {
    critical: 40,
    high: 20,
    medium: 5,
    low: 1,
  },
};
```

This structure makes it straightforward to tune the quality gate without changing analysis controllers or engines.

---

## Authentication

All routes except `POST /auth/token` require a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>
```

The `TokenGuard` in `src/auth/token.guard.ts` validates the token before allowing access to protected endpoints.

---

## Swagger / API Documentation

Interactive API documentation is powered by `@nestjs/swagger`.

### Accessing the docs

```text
http://localhost:3000/docs
```

If your application uses a global prefix such as `api`, the docs path will follow that prefix accordingly.

### Authenticating in Swagger UI

1. Open `/docs`.
2. Click **Authorize**.
3. Paste your Bearer token.
4. Test protected routes directly from the UI.

### Upload endpoint in Swagger

The upload route is documented as `multipart/form-data` and exposes the binary `file` field plus additional form fields.

---

## GitHub Actions Integration

A workflow is provided at `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`. It now packages the checked-out repository as a `.zip`, uploads it to `POST /analyze/upload`, parses the JSON response with `jq`, and fails the pipeline if the quality gate is not met.

### Required repository secrets

| Secret              | Description                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `QUALITY_API_URL`   | Public URL of the Batmanuel API            |
| `QUALITY_API_TOKEN` | Bearer token used to authenticate requests |

### Example workflow

```yaml
name: Code Quality Check

  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  batmanuel:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Create source archive
        run: |
          zip -r source-code.zip . \
            -x ".git/*" \
            -x "node_modules/*" \

            -w "%{http_code}")

          echo "HTTP status: $HTTP_STATUS"
          echo "Response body:"
          cat response.json

          if [ "$HTTP_STATUS" != "200" ] && [ "$HTTP_STATUS" != "201" ]; then
            echo "Batmanuel API returned unexpected HTTP status: $HTTP_STATUS"
            exit 1
          fi
        env:
          QUALITY_API_URL: ${{ secrets.QUALITY_API_URL }}
          QUALITY_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.QUALITY_API_TOKEN }}

      - name: Validate response schema
        run: |
          if ! jq -e '.passed != null and .score != null and .threshold != null' response.json > /dev/null; then
            echo "Response JSON does not contain passed/score/threshold."
            echo "Actual response:"
            cat response.json
            exit 1
          fi

      - name: Check quality gate
        run: |
          PASSED=$(jq -r '.passed' response.json)
          SCORE=$(jq -r '.score' response.json)
          THRESHOLD=$(jq -r '.threshold' response.json)

          echo "Score: $SCORE (threshold: $THRESHOLD)"

          if [ "$PASSED" != "true" ]; then
            echo "Quality gate failed: score $SCORE is below threshold $THRESHOLD."
            exit 1
          fi

          echo "Quality gate passed."
```

### Integration flow

1. Check out the repository.
2. Compress the source code into `source-code.zip`.
3. Upload the archive to `POST /analyze/upload`.
4. Read `passed`, `score`, and `threshold` from `response.json`.
5. Fail the workflow if the repository does not satisfy the configured quality gate.

## Roadmap

- Persistence of historical reports in PostgreSQL.
- Expanded analysis engines for security and dependency scanning.
- Angular dashboard for score trends and issue exploration.
- Standalone CLI for local project analysis and API submission.
- Additional CI integrations beyond GitHub Actions.
